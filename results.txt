- The user did not administer CPR, which is a crucial step in cardiac arrest resuscitation.
- The user did not check medical history before administering epinephrine, which could lead to adverse reactions.
- The user administered only one shock with defibrillator, whereas the expected procedure calls for multiple shocks if necessary.
- The user administered only one dose of amiodarone, although it's unclear why this was done instead of a recommended protocol that often involves administering amiodarone in combination with other medications.
- There is no mention of checking patient's airway or breathing, which is another critical step in cardiac arrest care.

You can improve by thoroughly reviewing the cardiac arrest resuscitation protocols and practicing these procedures to ensure accuracy.

• Checked Patient Details was performed 8 days after the Start of Simulation - Delayed.
• Checked Medical History was performed after Checking Patient Details - Incorrect order.
• Checked Vitals should have been performed before Administering CPR but was not in the user's procedure.
• Attached Defibrillator and shocked patient were performed out of sequence, however, with a short delay in between.
• Shocks delivered to the patient had the same energy level, however the actual expected shocks occurred at different time intervals (1min 30sec - 2 min 20sec apart).
• Administered Epinephrine was given orally but not with the correct dosage and it should have been administered after shocking the patient.

- You correctly administered CPR with a compression depth of 2 inches and a rate of 100/min, but it would be ideal if you included the duration of CPR.
- You attached the defibrillator, which is correct, but it's recommended to check the patient's medical history before doing so.
- Your epinephrine administration seems correct, but make sure to specify the route (IV or PO) and dose in a future simulation.
- You administered amiodarone correctly as an oral medication, just like in the expected procedure.
- However, you shocked the patient twice with the same energy setting. Ideally, you would have varied the energy levels for each shock.
- Lastly, you didn't include any checks on the patient's vitals between CPR cycles or before administering epinephrine and amiodarone.

Don't worry, practice makes perfect! Focus on improving your CPR technique, medical history check, and medication administration in future simulations.
